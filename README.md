# dotfiles

These dotfiles are managed using the [dot](https://github.com/nireo/dot) tool. These are mainly for macOS and I only use tmux, zsh, and kitty currently. The other dotfiles are mainly just for having a backup of them. To install these, the easiest way is to install the tool and then:

```
$ dot link
```
